                    Whether you like it or not, technology is rapidly improving, offering new innovations and
                    revolutionary projects every year. Some of the very sharpest minds are out there creating the next
                    piece of future technology that will completely change how we live our lives. It can feel like
                    scientific progress is steady but we have lived through a period of immense technological
                    improvement in the last half century.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">No longer a science fiction trope, the use of brain reading technology
                has improved hugely in recent years. One of the most interesting and practical uses we’ve seen tested so
                far comes from researchers at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL).

                <br> Thanks to a machine-learning algorithm, a robot arm and a brain-computer interface, these
                researchers have managed to create a means for tetraplegic patients (those who can’t move their upper or
                lower body) to interact with the world.

                <br> In tests, the robot arm would perform simple tasks like moving around an obstacle. The algorithm
                would then interprets signals from the brain using an EEG cap and automatically determine when the arm
                had made a move that the brain considered incorrect, for example moving too close to the obstacle or
                going too fast.

                <br> Over time the algorithm can then adjust to the individuals preferences and brain signals. In the
                future this could lead to wheelchairs controlled by the brain or assistance machines for tetraplegic
                patients.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">3D printing is an industry promising everything from cheap house
                building through to affordable rugged armour, but one of the most interesting uses of the technology is
                the building of 3D printed bones.
                <br>
                The company Ossiform specialises in medical 3D printing, creating patient-specific replacements of
                different bones from tricalcium phosphate – a material with similar properties to human bones.
                <br>
                Using these 3D printed bones is surprisingly easy. A hospital can perform an MRI which is then sent to
                Ossiform who create a 3D model of the patient-specific implant that is needed. The surgeon accepts the
                design and then once it is printed, it can be used in surgery.
                <br>
                What is special about these 3D printed bones is that because of the use of tricalcium phosphate, the
                body will remodel the implants into vascularised bone. That means they will enable the full restoration
                of function that the bone it is replacing had. To achieve the best integration possible, the implants
                are of a porous structure and feature large pores and canals for cells to attach to and reform bone.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Artificial eyes</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Bionic eyes have been a mainstay of science fiction for decades, but now
                real-world research is beginning to catch up with far-sighted storytellers. A raft of technologies is
                coming to market that restore sight to people with different kinds of vision impairment.
                <br>
                In January 2021, Israeli surgeons implanted the world’s first artificial cornea into a bilaterally
                blind, 78-year-old man. When his bandages were removed, the patient could read and recognise family
                members immediately. The implant also fuses naturally to human tissue without the recipient’s body
                rejecting it.
                <br>
                Likewise in 2020, Belgian scientists developed an artificial iris fitted to smart contact lenses that
                correct a number of vision disorders. And scientists are even working on wireless brain implants that
                bypass the eyes altogether.
                <br>
                Researchers at Montash University in Australia are working on trials for a system whereby users wear a
                pair of glasses fitted with a camera. This sends data directly to the implant, which sits on the surface
                of the brain and gives the user a rudimentary sense of sight.
